    "### Seating Arrangement in Covid\n",
    "\n",
    "- Owners of a movie theater must ensure that they can safely seat customers at minimum 2 meters of distance, while trying to seat as many people as possible to maximize their profit. Customers often visit a stadium show in groups. Members of a group must be seated together, but spectators in different groups must be seated at a safe distance away from other groups. \n",
    "- We will approach this issue as a bin packing problem. Each group is treated as a ‘box’ with a buffer zone of one seat surrounding the group on all sides. Each of these‘augmented groups’ (groups with buffer space) can now be packed adjacent to each other to maximize thegroups seated in a stadium. \n",
    "- We define an augmented row to be 3 ‘theater rows’ (the row in which the group is seated plus the buffer row above and below that row). \n",
    "- The total number of augmented rows in the stadium to be (the total number of regular rows/3). \n",
    "- Groups can only be seated in a single row (not in multiple rows), so the maximum allowed size of an augmented group is less than or equal to  W, the number of seats in one row. \n",
    "- The demand (people/groups who want to be seated is known ahead of time). Out of these, some will be seated, and some will not be seated.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Intro to our Model:\n",
    "- Cineplex is considering seating groups, indexed i \\in I in an theatre with rows j \\in J and the width of the rows to contain W seats.\n",
    "- Each group was a width in number of seats, w. \n",
    "- Each row can contain up to W seats\n",
    "- The objective is to minimize the total number of surplus(empty) seats in the theater to ensure that the maximium number of people can be seated. Social distancing is maintained due to the augumented group structure, where there will be a minimum of 2 seats between 2 groups seated in the same row.\n",
